**Hello, and welcome to my GitHub!**

I'm an econometrician specializing in the analysis of panel (longitudinal) data and the use of machine learning techniques to estimate econometric models. My research also focuses on model selection for mixed effects models.
Currently, I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in Statistics at the University of Geneva.
